This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00279-4

In the face of the challenges posed by the VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) era, companies need organizational resilience to adopt effective countermeasures and thrive amid disruption. On the basis of a sample of 2502 A-share manufacturing companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2007 to 2022, this study explores the relationship between digital-real integration and organizational resilience, highlighting the mediating role of supply chain concentration and ambidextrous innovation. The empirical results demonstrate that (a) organizational resilience in manufacturing companies can be successfully enhanced by digital-real integration. (b) Supply chain concentration and ambidextrous innovation serve as both simple and chain mediators that link organizational resilience and digital-real integration. Moreover, the heterogeneity results indicate that distinctions exist among companies that have property rights of different natures or are located in different regions. Thus, this study aims to explore the relationship between digital-real integration and organizational resilience, extend the research scope of supply chain concentration, and guide manufacturing companies through the ongoing wave of digitization.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12063-025-00566-9

To address this issue, this study develops fully biodegradable PLA/Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends compatibilized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional non-biodegradable compatibilizers. PLA/PBAT blends with varying ECO concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) were prepared via melt mixing and characterized using multiple techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed effective interactions between ECO, PLA, and PBAT, enhancing compatibility. Thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while contact angle measurements demonstrated an increase in hydrophilicity, confirming their suitability for biomedical applications. Mechanical testing revealed that PLA/PBAT blends with 1.0% ECO exhibited significantly improved elongation at break and impact strength without compromising tensile strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed uniform PBAT dispersion and enhanced interfacial morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferation, adhesion activity, and hemocompatibility assessments confirmed excellent biocompatibility, highlighting their potential for biomedical use. These findings suggest that ECO-modified PLA/PBAT blends offer a promising route for developing high-performance, biodegradable materials suitable for biomedical applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2
10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6,‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment,"Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6
10.1007/978-981-96-6250-0_33,"A Comparative Study on Association Rule Mining Algorithms Like Apriori, Fp-Growth, ECLAT, Enhanced Apriori, and Rapid Association Rule Mining","Association rule mining (ARM) is a technique within data analysis that focuses on identifying frequent patterns or itemsets from datasets. Several algorithms, such as Apriori and FP-Growth, have been developed to perform this task. In this paper, we explore a selection of well-established ARM algorithms, including Apriori, Frequent Pattern Growth (FP-Growth), Equivalence Class Clustering with a bottom-up Lattice Traversal (ECLAT), Rapid Association Rule Mining (RARM), and Enhanced Apriori. These algorithms represent both classic and modern approaches in ARM, offering a diverse spectrum of methodologies for frequent pattern extraction. This study aims to assess and compare the effectiveness of these algorithms on a real-world dataset of varying sizes. We utilize the online retail dataset from the UCI machine learning repository dividing it into four subsets for analysis. Each algorithm is tested on these subsets, and its performance is evaluated using several criteria, such as execution time, memory consumption, quality of generated rules, and the total number of rules produced. Furthermore, we assess the impact of different support thresholds on the quantity and quality of rules generated to provide a thorough comparison across all scenarios. The results show that Enhanced Apriori reduced execution time by 48% and memory consumption by 43% compared to Apriori. FP-Growth showed 43% faster execution time for small datasets and 63% faster performance for larger datasets, while consuming 45% less memory on small datasets and 50% less memory on larger datasets. Additionally, ECLAT performed 62% faster on small datasets and 47% faster on larger datasets, with 57% and 53% lower memory consumption, respectively. These findings highlight significant efficiency improvements in both runtime and memory usage, especially for larger datasets, and provide valuable insights into selecting algorithms based on dataset characteristics and ARM application requirements.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-96-6250-0_33

However, detecting suspicious transactions remains a challenging task due to the complexity and scale of financial processes, as well as the adaptive nature of fraudulent behaviors. Traditionally, database examinations have relied on manual reviews and specific queries, which are time-consuming and may overlook hidden patterns. Existing methods in the literature often struggle with scalability, lack of automation, and limited ability to capture process deviations effectively. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic method of advanced data analytics combining process mining principles exists in this field. This work presents a novel approach that integrates multiple process mining techniques, including process discovery and conformance checking, to model business processes and systematically identify deviations associated with suspicious activities. The experimental results depict the ability of the proposed approach to detect the suspicious transactions and fraudulent activities.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-07336-5_14

Those communities face additional problems as they traditionally rely on coal mining as a major source of employment and economic activity. The study focuses on Serbia as a representative case of post-socialist Western Balkans society. Serbia’s energy consumption depends largely on coal production. Kolubara and Kostolac are the largest open-pit coal-mining regions in Serbia, whose municipalities are among the top-ranked in terms of income in the country, but face challenges in reducing environmental impacts. Their local communities are potentially the most vulnerable to the effects of the green transition process.

The accumulated data provide a basis for analytics and subsequent decision-making of online teachers and university administration. Researchers utilize educational data mining for different purposes by means of searching templates in these data. A field connected with controlling quality of fulfillment of free response assignments has remained largely untouched, though. Decision support for online teachers, implementing this procedure, allows to reduce the influence of the human factor, associated with over-loading and time constraints, and enhance the control quality. To carry out such support for online teachers, an approach and intelligent decision support system, developed with the usage of mining data being stored in a learning management system when controlling quality of fulfillment of free response assignments, are proposed in the paper. Based on experiment results, it was discovered that the system detects errors in performed free response assignments missed by online teachers, which proves its efficiency and usefulness for education process.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-04761-8_22

Such libraries can be used to create ML pipelines that consist of a series of steps where each step may invoke up to several ML libraries that are used for various data-driven analytical tasks. Development of high-quality ML pipelines is non-trivial; it requires training, ML expertise, and careful development of each step. At the same time, domain experts in science and engineering may not possess such ML expertise and training while they are in pressing need of ML-based analytics. In this paper, we present our ExeKGLib , a Python library enhanced with a graphical interface layer that allows users with minimal ML knowledge to build ML pipelines. This is achieved by relying on knowledge graphs that encode ML knowledge in simple terms accessible to non-ML experts. ExeKGLib also allows improving the transparency and reusability of the built ML workflows and ensures that they are executable.

Rule-based recommenders offer efficient, interpretable, accurate, and trustworthy recommendations, addressing key challenges in recommender design. Using association rules having a single or multiple conditions, we build transparent white-box models, especially for long-tail items. Moreover, recent studies challenge the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. However, aspects beyond accuracy and efficiency—such as popularity bias, coverage, diversity, and comprehensibility—have largely been overlooked in prior evaluations. Additionally, well-known higher-order rule-based recommender methods lack scalability. Finally, many methods have been proposed that vary in rule form, scoring measures, aggregation and inference strategies. We introduce RuleRec, a scalable toolkit offering six seminal rule-based recommenders. We extend Apriori, MSApriori and adaptive-support rule mining, thereby presenting novel algorithms based on the generalization of pairwise rule-mining using an inverted index. We find that the proposed algorithms are an order of magnitude more efficient. Finally, we empirically evaluate six rule-based recommender algorithms on six benchmark datasets, comparing their accuracy, efficiency, diversity, popularity bias, and comprehensibility. To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an efficient open-source implementation and comparative evaluation over multiple rule-based recommenders.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-08887-1_6

We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases.
