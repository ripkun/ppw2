This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00279-4

In the face of the challenges posed by the VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) era, companies need organizational resilience to adopt effective countermeasures and thrive amid disruption. On the basis of a sample of 2502 A-share manufacturing companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2007 to 2022, this study explores the relationship between digital-real integration and organizational resilience, highlighting the mediating role of supply chain concentration and ambidextrous innovation. The empirical results demonstrate that (a) organizational resilience in manufacturing companies can be successfully enhanced by digital-real integration. (b) Supply chain concentration and ambidextrous innovation serve as both simple and chain mediators that link organizational resilience and digital-real integration. Moreover, the heterogeneity results indicate that distinctions exist among companies that have property rights of different natures or are located in different regions. Thus, this study aims to explore the relationship between digital-real integration and organizational resilience, extend the research scope of supply chain concentration, and guide manufacturing companies through the ongoing wave of digitization.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s12063-025-00566-9
10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2,Development of Toughened Poly (lactic acid) by Melt Blending with Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) Using Epoxidized Castor Oil as a Compatibilizer for Biomedical Applications,"Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is a bioderived and biodegradable thermoplastic widely used in various applications; however, its brittleness limits its mechanical performance. To address this issue, this study develops fully biodegradable PLA/Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends compatibilized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional non-biodegradable compatibilizers. PLA/PBAT blends with varying ECO concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) were prepared via melt mixing and characterized using multiple techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed effective interactions between ECO, PLA, and PBAT, enhancing compatibility. Thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while contact angle measurements demonstrated an increase in hydrophilicity, confirming their suitability for biomedical applications. Mechanical testing revealed that PLA/PBAT blends with 1.0% ECO exhibited significantly improved elongation at break and impact strength without compromising tensile strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed uniform PBAT dispersion and enhanced interfacial morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferation, adhesion activity, and hemocompatibility assessments confirmed excellent biocompatibility, highlighting their potential for biomedical use. These findings suggest that ECO-modified PLA/PBAT blends offer a promising route for developing high-performance, biodegradable materials suitable for biomedical applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/s44174-025-00308-2
10.1007/978-3-032-09929-7_12,Geotechnical Challenges and Suitable Methodology for Highwall Mining of Coal Seams with Less Than 3 Metre Parting,"The success of highwall mining in multi-seam conditions depends largely on proper mining sequence and web pillar design. Highwall web pillars, being long and slender, are more susceptible to failure. Mining coal seams with < 3 m parting causes geotechnical issues like strata instability, seam interactions, stress concentrations, spalling, pillar collapse, and subsidence. Parting stability is governed by several factors such as cover depth, parting thickness, eccentricity between roadways, extraction ratio, in-situ stress, and rock competency. Pillar failure, whether progressive or instantaneous, is primarily controlled by the width-to-height (w/h) ratio; undersized pillars—spalling extends inward, eventually leading to collapse. Additionally, failure of thin partings may lead to heightened pillars with low w/h ratios, making them unstable. A case study on the proposed highwall mining at Gare Palma IV/1 mine, operated by M/s Jindal Power Limited, has been discussed. Highwall mining is planned for three coal seams viz. IX, VIII, and VII(T + M)—measuring 5 m, 4 m, and 6 m thick, respectively. The cover depth in the mining area varies from 78.43 to 108.75 m. The IX seam, the uppermost seam, lies 2 m above the VIII seam, while the VIII seam is separated from the VII(T + M) seam by 9 m. The study aims to design an extraction methodology for coal seams with low parting.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-09929-7_12

The stories of our societies and our ancestors are wrapped in intangible connections with the ocean and preserved on the seafloor as artefacts, shipwrecks, and remains of those lost or buried at sea. Deep sea mining (DSM) threatens this Ocean Heritage and has the potential to destroy crucial pieces of our past and disrupt our deep cultural connections to the ocean. This book is designed to highlight the potential threat of DSM, covered here mostly in international waters and as regulated by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), and make ocean professionals across many different fields aware of those dangers and of the work is being done to help mitigate the possible launch of DSM operations. It does not aim to be the final word on the issue but rather start a discussion and encourage scientists and cultural leaders to engage and work together.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-98238-5_1

10.1007/978-3-032-05569-9_12,Polenta and Cyanide? Investment Arbitration as Prospective Environmental Injustice in Roșia Montană,"Around the world, local communities supported by national and transnational advocacy networks are fighting to defend or preserve their homes and livelihoods from extractivist projects that threaten their environments. In this chapter, we look at Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) as a form of prospective environmental (in)justice (PEJ). ISDS provides for multinational corporations to sue states when they have a grievance over the state’s treatment of their investment. We argue that ISDS continues the structural violence of extractive projects and the pre-project harms resulting from foreign investor-welcoming climates. The chapter draws on empirical research on the Roșia Montană case in Romania to extend the theory of PEJ to scenarios where communities have succeeded in stopping a mining project, but the investor brings arbitration against the state, thus prolonging the “soft” extractive violence. We analyse how grassroots movements formed coalitions with national and foreign NGOs, succeeded in stopping a Canadian mining project based on cyanide extraction, and inscribed Roșia Montană as a UNESCO World Heritage site. In response, the Canadian mining company instigated investment arbitration proceedings against Romania. The case illustrates that, despite the legal victory of the Romanian state, international investment arbitration potentially allows “green crime”, rendering it awfully lawful.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-05569-9_12

However, historical data about mineral occurrences is often locked in disparate, unstructured, and inconsistent formats, ranging from government databases to mining reports and journal articles. To address this challenge, we have developed a set of scalable technologies that extract, normalize, and semantically integrate information from these sources into a unified knowledge graph. Our approach combines ontology-driven modeling, large-language models for information extraction and classification, and tools for linking and validating data across sources. The result is a semantically enriched, queryable knowledge graph that supports reproducible analysis, expert validation, and geoscientific applications such as deposit classification and prospectivity modeling. Through this work, we have successfully integrated information from hundreds of thousands of records across multiple historical sources to build one of the world’s largest repositories of structured data on critical minerals.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-09530-5_26
10.1007/978-3-032-09929-7_53,Decarbonizing the Indian Coal Mining Sector: Strategic Pathways to Achieve Net Zero Emissions,"The Indian coal mining sector is a prime mover of the national energy supply. This sector urgently needs strategically designed pathways towards net zero emissions due to increasing concern for climate change and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). A comprehensive approach integrating technological, operational, and policy-driven strategies is key to net-zero goals. This paper explores viable net-zero pathways for the Indian coal mining sector based on three strategic pillars: (1) decarbonization of mining operations, (2) mitigation of fugitive emissions and, (3) adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Decarbonizing mining operations involves the electrification of mining equipment. Integrating renewable energy and adopting energy-efficient measures in coal mining operations could lead to reduced GHG emissions. Mitigating fugitive methane emissions from coal mining activities is also a key step for decarbonization. The fugitive methane emissions could effectively be reduced using advanced ventilation air methane (VAM) oxidation and coal mine methane (CMM) end-use technologies. This paper evaluates the applicability of these approaches in the Indian coal mining sector. Integrating CCUS technologies in the coal mining sector can reduce its carbon footprint. Deep virgin coal seams could be utilized to store large amounts of CO_2 and to recover methane. A holistic approach to achieving net zero requires enabling policies, regulatory frameworks and financial incentives. Government intervention, carbon pricing mechanisms and industry collaboration are essential to drive investment in low-carbon technologies. This paper also highlights the importance of innovative technologies, policy support and cross-sectoral collaboration in achieving net-zero emissions in the coal mining sector. These strategies offer a practical road map for the Indian coal mining industry to align with national and global climate targets while ensuring energy security and economic development.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-09929-7_53
10.1007/978-3-032-08324-1_4,Bridging the Interpretability Gap in Process Mining: A Comprehensive Approach Combining Explainable Clustering and Generative AI,"Process mining often yields highly complex “Spaghetti Models”, making them difficult to interpret and impeding informed decision-making. Therefore, researchers have explored clustering of event logs to simplify process models and reduce their complexity. However, the unsupervised nature of clustering can introduce an interpretation gap, necessitating manual effort to identify differences and similarities across the resulting process models. To address these issues, we propose an explainable clustering approach that identifies key subprocesses and applies eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to clarify the rationale behind model partitioning. Moreover, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) into the process discovery procedure to generate natural language descriptions and compare the discovered process models, enhancing user understanding, engagement, and making complex technical details more accessible. A case study demonstrates that our method operates effectively across various LLMs, preserving vital contextual information while simplifying the process discovery workflow. Our findings reveal that larger models generally ensure completeness, whereas smaller ones offer more efficiency at the expense of explanation quality, highlighting the importance of a balanced LLM choice for practical applications.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-08324-1_4

We then focus on recent approaches for a cross-fertilization between pattern discovery and neural-based Machine Learning approaches. Specifically, neural methods have been developed for pattern mining and pattern set mining, enabling more efficient exploration of structural motifs in complex datasets.

While recent advances in argumentation mining have begun to bridge the gap between natural language texts and structured argumentation frameworks, the tasks for mining ABA structure are still underexplored, especially the contrary mining task—identifying contraries of assumptions from text. This paper extends prior work on ABA-based argument mining by introducing the first dataset on hotel reviews. Indeed, we construct a novel, fine-grained annotation scheme for contraries within hotel reviews from Booking.com, enriching the existing ABA-annotated corpus. Furthermore, we evaluate the in-context learning abilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, on the contrary mining task under few-shot settings.

10.1007/978-3-032-08887-1_6,Scalable Evaluation of Rule-Based Recommender Systems: Algorithms and Benchmarks,"Recommender systems help users to identify the most relevant items from a huge collection of items. Rule-based recommenders offer efficient, interpretable, accurate, and trustworthy recommendations, addressing key challenges in recommender design. Using association rules having a single or multiple conditions, we build transparent white-box models, especially for long-tail items. Moreover, recent studies challenge the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. However, aspects beyond accuracy and efficiency—such as popularity bias, coverage, diversity, and comprehensibility—have largely been overlooked in prior evaluations. Additionally, well-known higher-order rule-based recommender methods lack scalability. Finally, many methods have been proposed that vary in rule form, scoring measures, aggregation and inference strategies. We introduce RuleRec, a scalable toolkit offering six seminal rule-based recommenders. We extend Apriori, MSApriori and adaptive-support rule mining, thereby presenting novel algorithms based on the generalization of pairwise rule-mining using an inverted index. We find that the proposed algorithms are an order of magnitude more efficient. Finally, we empirically evaluate six rule-based recommender algorithms on six benchmark datasets, comparing their accuracy, efficiency, diversity, popularity bias, and comprehensibility. To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an efficient open-source implementation and comparative evaluation over multiple rule-based recommenders.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-08887-1_6
